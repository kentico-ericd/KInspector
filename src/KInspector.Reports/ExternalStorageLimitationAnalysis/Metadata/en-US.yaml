  shortDescription: Checks whether media libraries are following recommendations for external storage.

    Web sites utilizing external storage (Azure Blob or Amazon S3) should limit media library folder size to a maximum 100 items per folder. If you exceed the limit, alter the structure that allows you to divide the files into multiple folders.
